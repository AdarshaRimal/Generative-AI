            "Cristiano let me start just by asking you why are you doing this interview with me because I think it's the time to say something um and because I like you simple as that well don't say that in public well I like you too and I appreciate it because I think that you've had to sustain a lot of criticism this year in particular probably more than at any stage in your career and I think it's time to set the record straight and to clear up a few things not least I suspect for the fans of Manchester United they must be wondering what the hell's been going on oh as I as I say many many times the fans they always I'm always going to say good about them they are um the most important things in a football you play for them they always in my side I feel that every time when I go when I walk in the streets the fans come to me and um they appreciate uh what I did what I do for football and for me it's the most important in football the fans for me is everything I want to take you back to last year last summer you're at Juventus and there's massive speculation about where you're going to go and the big rumor is that you're going to go to Manchester City so first of all how close was that to happening well h honestly um it was close it was close is something that they spoke a lot and Guardiola say two weeks ago I guess that they try um they try hard to have me but as you know as my history in Manchester United your heart your feeling the way the history that you did um before make the difference and of of course as well Sir Alex Ferguson so I was I was surprised in the same way but it was conscience decision uh because the heart speak speaking loud in that moment you were a Manchester United Legend So when you say your heart LED you it's because of that the history you have with the club and the relationship you maintained with s Alex with the fans I think it was it was the key it was the the difference in that moment but I cannot be loyal if I would I would say that Manchester City wasn't close uh but I think I I did conscious decision um I don't regret at some point and um as you mentioned before Sir Alex Ferguson was was the key as well did you speak to him before you yes I did yes I did I spoke I spoke with them with him and um what did he say to you to try and persuade you he said to me that um it's it's impossible for you to come to Manchester City and I say okay boss so I took the decisions and I repeat with very I was with conscience that it was um a good decision you came back and it couldn't have started better you played at Old Trafford yeah you won 4-1 against Newcastle you scored twice Alex Sir Alex was there loving it obviously the return of the prodigal son your mother was there the return of her own son your mother was crying obviously obviously yes but what a what a comeback uh how did that feel that day when when you came off the pitch well that feeling was amazing but not only the day of the game I F I felt before the week before that everything changed the world speak about me Cristiano back home back where they belong so it was a special special moment to be back to Manchester United to perform for uh our fans and of course to score two goals was the best welcome that I receive in Old Trafford it was Memorial day and uh unbelievable day too the Viva Ronaldo chart went up yes viva Ronaldo you like hearing that be back of of course I did as I as I told you before the fans for me they are everything two things happened uh I think within 24 hours of you resigning for United one you broke the alltime record for shirt sales in 24 hours you actually beat a guy called Messi at PSG you must have been happy about that of course I do uh as as you know I'm I'm I don't follow the records the records follow me so it's good another one in my in my book and the other one was the Manchester United tweet announcing that you were rejoining the club was the most tweeted or most liked tweet I think in Twitter history it's good as I told you before it was good moment nobody expect because things change around in my opinion in 72 hours which is you plan or they spoke not only Manchester City but other clubs too spoke about your name that you will change Juventus for another club but Manchester United wasn't there wasn't in that pot of that teams but surprise everybody even me to be honest after a few weeks things weren't going well at Manchester United the club just wasn't firing and in the end Ole gasosa the manager got sacked and that's within like two months of you coming back what were you feeling about what was going on at United and what did you feel generally about the club itself and the state that the club was in compared to when you'd been there before B to be honest when I I signed for Manchester United I thought everything was changed because it's 13 years that I'm changed uh I was in Real Madrid 9 years and train Juventus and when I ared I thought everything will be different you know the technology the infrastructures and everything but I was surprised in a bad way let's say in that way because I saw everything was the same uh and Manchester it wasn't it wasn't in that moment that as you mentioned that o was suck Michael Carrick he assumed the the the job for two two games V and Chelsea away um and everything was was so but surprised me a lot uh instability in the club um everything was kind of the same that I that I hadn't moved on no they they stopped on on a clock in my opinion which is something that that surpris me I didn't expect and um slowly and slowly they start to change even even the the windows the new players and um was tough was tough for me because I didn't expect that and uh because when you were there before if Manchester United wanted a player under Sir Alex Ferguson they normally got their man right now it's a very different environment after many years of failure since Sir Alex retired United weren't getting the top players anymore so were you surprised by that Dynamic changing as well because you would have been used before to them if they wanted top players they got them I was surprised I thought when I signed that they signed in that year Sano and Varan plus me that things will be in the way that Manchester should be as you mentioned well sir Alex Fon left a big gap in the club not only Sir Alex Ferman one person that I thought make the difference David Gil the president very very good man and the structure around s Alex fergon was very important too I knew it that Manchester United was wasn't the same but I don't see that it was so big gap so big things that go through by the last 10 years and it was the thing that surprised me more to be honest was little things like even the the swimming pool that the players use the saers all these facilities nothing had changed since you'd left in 2009 nothing Chang surprisingly not only the pool the jacuzzi even the gym even some points the technology the kitchen the shfs which is I appreciate lovely lovely persons they stop in a in a time which is is it surprised me a lot I thought I will see different things different as I mentioned before technology infrastructure um but unfortunately we see many things that I'm used to see when I was 20 21 23 so so surprised me a lot you'd also of course as you said you've been at Real Madrid and Juventus where you saw them moving all the time to progress with technology the latest thing to improve performance level so you were able to compare what you'd experienced there with what was not happening in united in United they the progress was zero in my opinion um to compare with Real Madrid and even Juventus that they follow the world so the the technology especially the terms of of training nutrition and um conditions of uh it properly and to recover better than before surprised me uh Manchester right now to compare with that club I think it's it's behind in my opinion which is is something that surprised me a club with this Dimension um should be in the top of the tree in my my opinion and they are not unfortunately um they are not in that level but I hope the next years they can reach to be in a top level when you look at I mean United have had some of the best managers in the world follow Sir Alex Ferguson and they've all been relative failures compared to other stages of their careers do you think that partly that's down to the the structural element of this the just isn't the support that top managers need I don't know what's going on but since since the S Alex Ferguson left I saw not evolution in the club the progress was Zero for example you have a interesting point that how the club as Manchester United after suck um o they buy they bring sport directive Ral rnck which is something that nobody understand this guy is is not even a coach a bigger club like Manchester United bring sport directive surprise not only me but all the world you know well it was a ridiculous decision wasn't it of course in my opinion it's you have to be honest if you're not if you're not even a coach how you going to be the boss of Manchester United it's something that I should see that Manchester is not followed not not the right way to reach successful like other teams like for example Liverpool or Manchester City Chelsea they are uh one step behind or two uh because of this kind of mistakes in my opinion that they should improve and change probably the the staff or or the people uh the directives or presidents I don't know who is the who is the problem there but did it show a lack of ambition to you when they replaced Ole ganos solska who a lot of fans liked but he obviously wasn't delivering the big titles that United wanted and were used to but to a point someone like Ralph Randy I mean I'd never heard of him and I'm thinking if no and I'm thinking if has you heard of him no of course not you've never heard of this guy nobody and the people who I speak nobody knew it was him and suddenly he's did you call him the boss of course I I respect we have to call because he assumed the the job uh regardless the all the coaches that I had in my career I call them boss because if they assume the the job we have to call in that way but in the end deep deep inside me I I never saw him as a boss because I saw some points that I never agreed and uh he stopping a time as well because if you're not being a coach the the last the next five years you're going going to you know you're going to lost the identity of to be a coach so surprised me a lot but in the same way don't surprise me a lot because if you see the structures is keep they keeping the same so the coaches didn't surprise me but was a tough moment what what was extraordinary was very quickly after rck took over it started briefing journalists that you weren't pressing enough and that maybe it would be a good idea if you moved on from the club and I'm like who is this guy why and why is he saying this to the man who's scoring the goals to be honest P it's something that I I don't understand it's the new coaches that coming around they think they find the last Coca-Cola in the desert which is that I don't understand the football D invents many many years so but I respect any coach have a different approach different opinions different mentality but kind of some points that you you not agree so I'm always like that in my life I'm always been besides the best coaches in the worlds zidan andelot Mourinho Fernando Santos allegri so I had kind of some experience because I learn from them and when you see some coaches that they're coming that they want to re Revolution the football I not agree I I I have my opinion they agree or they don't they disagree but it's part of the the business because I'm in the end of the day I'm in a club to win and with my experience I want to help like always and I some coaches that don't accept and U you know it's part of the job did he know what he was doing Randy or not at a club like United no they don't um they knew with the club very well but they don't know the of the dimension of the club inside the history of the club which is for me surpris me even more which is when you the suck all s you should bring a top manager not sport director did you think it was right to to get rid of solka or would you have kept him up well it's not well I love s SK I think it was a top person because what I what I keep inside my heart it's the heart of the persons and all for me is that top person coach of course he wasn't he didn't he didn't look for what he what he wants it's hard is hard to assume after Sir Alex Ferguson but I think he did a good job for for sure he need more more time but I'm never doubt that you're going to be a good a good coach in the future but it was a good experience I was I was so pleased to work with him even a short period what about the younger players and and specifically their mentality because it seemed to me just from what I was reading when you were originally at Manchester United as a young 18-year-old that you had huge respect for the older players the KE and these guys in the dressing room and you would soak up their experience their wisdom and so on did you get that same respect do you think from the younger players I don't mean that they don't respect the experienced players or the oldest players I don't I don't I don't think that word is the the best one but they live in a different era um I can see my kid they have 12 years old the mentality are not the same they are not suffer that what's the difference the anger I think the anger I think that they have the things more easily everything it's easily they don't suffer and I think it's they don't care I don't mean only a few in Manchester with all the teams all all leagues in the world the the youngest they are not the same of my generation but we cannot blame blame them because it's part of the life you know the new generation and um the the new technologies that avoid uh the distract them for another thing so but they are not the same that they listen but this is why we have two hear you listen from one side and they go away from another side so don't surprise me but in the same way is a little bit shame because if they have the best examples in front of your eyes and if they don't at least copy what you did for me it's kind it's kind of weird because I remember when I was 18 1920s I'm always look to see the best players vanister Roy Ferdinand Roy kin and uh gigs this is why I have the successful that I have in levity because I take care of my body my mental my head because I see these guys and I learn from them when you try and give advice to these younger players what what do you say to them what do you what do you try and guide them to be like I think the best advice I'm not the kind of guys to like to give advice as I prer to be as example yes because I'm I'm example I'm there every morning I do the same stuff I'm probably the first ones to arrive in the want to to go out I think the the details speak for itself so because as I as I told you before um they'll listen one thing and in two minutes they already forgot and do it whatever they think it's it's it's better this is why I say I like to lead by example and um some ones they follow me not much but uh see I find that I just find that incredible that if I was a young footballer and I had Cristiano Ronaldo at my club that I wouldn't want to spend every second watching him listening to him observing the way you go about your business and yet from what you're saying clearly that's not they're not interested they don't care some ones yes but most of them no but for me it's not surpris me uh don't surpris me because they're not going to have levity careers in my opinion it's impossible it's impossible to see for example my generation you see many players they they reach 36 37 38 in high level I think this generation you're going to count by your hands how many going to reach in that level because this years of preparation it's helps a lot who are the players in the world that you most admire for their mental strength that their attitude it's it's difficult question because I'm I'm always can say what I see from my eyes for example if you tell me what I see for example in Manchester United I can mention probably dalot Dio dalot is example is young but he's very very professional and I'm not doubt that he going to Rich he going to have longevity in the football because he's he's young he's smart intelligent and he's very professional you have a few ones more but like him it's it's difficult to see probably Martinez um kimero 30s um but I will say theot so rics come in you it's your second manager it's not working the results aren't great you're still scoring goals regularly for Manchester United you're about the only one who is but then you get hit by an awful episode in your life probably the worst time of your life where your partner Georgina she's pregnant with twins and is actually giving birth to these two babies and your baby son doesn't survive and I don't think I can imagine I have four kids you have a lot of children you know you can't imagine a worse thing to happen than to go a full term of a pregnancy particularly for the poor mother in that case but also for you what was that like for you that that time in your life P probably the worst moment that I passed through my life since my my father died you know when you have a kid that you expect that everything will be normal and you have that uh problem it's it's hard you know as human being that I am in georgini why we had quite difficult moments because we don't understand why happened to us uh was difficult to be honest was was very very diff difficult to to understand what's going what's going on in that in that period of our life as you know the football carry on there are so fast many competitions the football don't stop we have many many competitions and pass through in that moment was probably the most difficult moment that I had in my life me and my my family especially Gio that was was tough she said um she was giving an interview about the new series of her TV show and she said in an interview a big piece of my heart shattered and I asked myself how I could carry on I had the answer nearer than I thought I looked into the eyes of my children and there I saw the only way of doing it being all together yeah I I I I saw too yeah this is why what we did we I grew up my my family especially GI and um we had the difficult moments but we said listen we have more more kids we have one that born Bella that we have to be happy to me such a difficult situation again where you're mourning the terrible loss of your little baby boy but also celebrating the birth of your beautiful daughter I try to explain sometimes to my family and even my close friends they say I never felt to be happy and s in the same moment yes I never felt it is hard to explain um so difficult so difficult it's you don't know if you cry or you don't know if you smile yes because it's something that you don't know how to react uh you don't know what to do to be honest and of course I remember very well that I look like I don't know the word that to Define what I felt in that moment but it's it's crazy feelings it's crazy emotional but as I told you before I I I have to to hold that we had at least Bella yes which is is the most important one die and one survive but it was it's difficult to explain how did you explain it all to your other children they must have been so confused about in the beginning you arriving home and the kids start to say where's another baby where's another baby of course Christiano I had conversation with him in the in the day because he's 12 years old he knows he understand everything and I had a nice conversation with him we cried together in his bedroom and he explained and it's kind of he didn't understand he understand but in the same way it was a little bit confused the other ones in the beginning in the table the kids start to say mom where is the uh the other baby blah blah blah and you in the beginning they start to say because you know she she had a little bit bely because they two it's hard process and after one week I say you let's let's let's be frontal let's be honest with the kids let's let's say that uh anel which is the name they go to the to the hien it's better to say in that way yes and uh we start to use in that in that uh in that way and the kids always understand when we had shots in a table and they say Daddy I did this for Angel and they they point out for the for the sky which is I I say and I and I like it the most because you know it's part of the lives and I I'm not going to lie to my kids to say the truth which is is was a difficult process but in the same way I become more more father more friendly of them they become more more close to his daddy especially me with georgin as well I was going to ask you that because these things they can they can make all break relationships because the grief can be so intense it can drive couples apart or it can bring them closer in my case it was more was better in that way I become more friendly of Gio I was of course friend but I see more more lovely for her and for my for my kids and I start to see the life with a different perspective you understand which is is coming the point of if if you're going to ask me for sure the pre season moments for example why I didn't go to the preseason I'm going to come to that yeah but it was just to finish in that that chapter was the most difficult moment the last since my dad die it was this moment that I passed through the last six months do you feel your son is is with you in spirit do you feel for sure for sure is ashes is with me like my daddy they are here house yes yes it's something that it's I want to hold for the rest of my life I'm not throw to the to the ocean or to the sea I keep with me there next to my to my daddy I didn't know if you you check have a small Church down and I you do yes I do like a little chapel yes chapel and I keep my dad in my son do you talk to them yes I do um I I I talk with them every time and that they are in my side they are you know they help me to be a better man to be a better person to be a better father and it's something that I really really proud that the message that they send me especially my my son amazing you had an extraordinary reaction from football fans obviously from Manchester United but I think you must have been just so surprised by the outpouring of not just support but liver fans sang on the seventh minute of their next game You'll Never Walk Alone the cop the great Infamous enemy of Manchester United what did you feel when you heard that I never ever expect that never I had opportunity now to to say all English Community thank you a lot for that kind of that they had with me not only Liverpool but all England I felt I was at arsenal when you played and on the seventh minute the whole crowd I receed I receive a letter from the queen family as well really yes I do which is is from the queen herself or yeah family yeah and um surprised me a lot offering their condolences yes wow unbelievable this is why I say I respect a lot the English Community English people uh because they they've been very kind uh with me and in that difficult moment on my life was spectacular are the way they treat me me and my family uh in that difficult moments I I should say straight to the CR and thank you thank thank you to Old English community that helped me in that moment the when the queen sadly died in September you posted a very nice tribute to her was part of the reason because of of what they had of course been like with you of course they've been so kind of with me and um this is why I did what I did uh but it was unbelievable moment I'm never ever going to forget that moment you have a little girl Bella she's six months old now must be a great joy amid all that terrible sadness unbelievable it was another member in the family they are the the shin of the house and uh we are so proud me Georgina and all all my kids they are they are very very proud for them they are they are spectacular a beautiful girl and we are so happy we are so so happy we are we are a Happy Fathers you're going to have more I'm not thinking now to thinking more kids I think we we done but we never know the future only Gods know but right now we want to to have a break to enjoy this ones because they are little Bella 6 and the rest they are five and Cristiano 12 we want to enjoy a little bit of this ones let's see the future it's very difficult to play top level football at the best of times it's a hard business in full public glare of millions of people watching to have to go back and play after this must have been incredibly hard for you even with your mental strength how did you find that difficult very difficult to to play after that but as I always have good support from my family and Georgina told me go go to play go enjoy to do what you like to do going to help for you to forgot forget a little bit the situation was difficult but in the same point I think helps helps for you to you know to don't thinking much about that even to training was good but as you know the the football going so fast and you know trainings games uh even the national team the things going so fast you don't have have a time to settle and say what's going on you know because the things going so fast but was good help Georgina helped me a lot to give me that possibility to say listen she's a very strong woman yes she is Georgina yes yes I mean really strong yes to to just to be your partner is probably not an easy time a lot of the time with all the attention all the time but to go through what she's gone through and still be there we help each other but she struggle when he when she is young which is she know she look at life in a different with a different eyes even she's young but she suffer you know she's she born in Argentina she have his issues with his family as well she live alone she have interesting uh life and histories as well history and she helped me a lot she's very mature for his age we we help each other sometimes when I'm a little bit down she push me up and I do it to the other side so we are a nice couple we help each other so I'm really pleased that she's in she's on on my side any any movement on the The Wedding Bells Cristiana I'm not thinking now about that but I can see in the future I think I deserve she deserve but it's something that com not coming now in my my plans but in the future I yes yes I want 4 days after the this terrible time in your life youit to get a new manager Eric tenh did you know much about him a little bit U through Ajax the job that he did for Ajax you end the season with 24 goals for Manchester United including 18 in the Premier League six in the Champions League he were second in the Golden Boot for the English football I mean by any normal yard Stak that's an incredible performance and yet you were still getting criticized it was almost like well it's got to be your fault even though you scored all the goals were you as bemused as I was that you were becoming the focal point for the criticism I think it's e it's easy to point out when you want to cover other things to put to point out Cristiano Ronaldo it's it's it's easy everyone now that that press they want to they want to put me in the first page because they know they will sell more theing will be different and I'm used to live like that because you I as 37 uh I know and I learn many things um when you are in the down of the wave when you are in the top of the wave it's you don't realize and you don't see things that you don't see before which is I appreciate to have bad moments to see which people is in your side who criticize you more because they're looking for that they don't like to see successful people the people only try to bring negativism and I felt the last four or five months that not only with for me but even for my family as well for Georgina especially around the world the Press criticize me even more sometimes I don't I don't understand why even Portuguese press that they criticize criticize me a lot I don't understand but I still believe that the jalous is part of that um they want to cover many things that helps to to to shine other things but listen pce I know I'm 25 21 years in the top of the game so I know all the takes so for me it's not a problem it's it's it's hard when you are a little bit down to listen the this criticize do do you read it all do you read newspapers do you read social media a good thing that I have it's I don't like to read because I know uh 90% of the times they lie they are garbage the Press they are garbage not all of them but most of them they don't say the truth um and they lie they constant lie and they constant attack me and my family they're always negativism against my family why I'm going to read because I know they try to to to make me feel bad me and my family which is is it's something hard to deal but in the end of the day I understand but it's it's really really hard the problem you have is you're to famous you are the most followed human being on Instagram that you have I just checked 495 million followers I have just under two million on Instagram 8 million on Twitter so I'm catching you on Twitter slowly but but 400 you're nearly at half a billion followers on Instagram that's insane you're bigger than all the Kardashians put together it's good it's good I feel proud for that it means it means a lot for me because it means that people like me too I'm charismatic I think why I'm the number one sometimes ask ask that question to myself why me and not another one why do you think it is to be honest I not just only because I I play good football because everyone knows but I think the rest is is relevant you have to be charismatic people have to to feel some connection with you I think to be good-looking helps too I I have the same yeah I feel the same way to be honest because I don't know the real reason but I think I'm charismatic and I'm I'm I'm a petitive fruit I don't know if we a what a fruit that people want to bite yeah I don't know the the how you can say in English any particular fruit or let's say strawberry but I don't know the the reason I mean what's incredible to me is the the power you have appetite appetite appetite appetite fruit appetite fruit I don't know if makes sense in English but if you it don't make sense you learn I I'll research appetite for it yeah I mean I have a pin tweet and it's you telling me I have good abdominals which is a very good observation and it's only 10 seconds long it's had 43 million views this clip so thank you because 43 million people have heard the guy who actually has got good abdominals tell me I've got good abdominals but it showed me the the sheer Firepower you have in that what in that world of social media it's just extraordinary is is is what I what I tell told you before um I have I have good things which is is you you can sell your own product let's say in that way but you have to to deal with many obstacles in your life too do you care if people hate you I mean a lot of people love you but obviously a lot of people don't you're so big you're going to get both but do you care about the ones who I care hate Cristiano Ronald I care the people who like me I'm not waste time for the people who don't like me I think it's waste of time this these people they are they are not interesting on my life I'm I like to be surround around the people who love me I don't I don't waste my time to to see the criticize of people who is next to me ex players for example uh I don't care mean one of your biggest critics has been and I'm surprised about this me too Wayne Rooney for example who you played with for many years very successfully and we good friends with him and yet all this year three or four times he's come out and attacked you in the media Pierce I don't understand you should ask this question to him but I don't know um I don't know why he criticize me so bad or I don't believe that jealous of me says your behavior is unacceptable United should sell you you know blah blah blah blah blah I mean Wayne Rooney surpris me it was one year ago or six months ago here in my house pick up his kids here and invite Christian to go his house to play football I don't I really don't understand people like that or if they want to be in the cover of the of the paper of the news or they want a new jobs or whatever is it jealousy as well perhaps that you're still playing and still in the maned probably because he finished his career with 30s so I'm still playing high level I'm not going to say that I'm looking better than him which is is true but but that is inarguable I mean there's no contest it's it's hard to listen that kind of criticized and negative about people who play with you for example Gary Neville as well yeah I mean Gary Neville you blanked him the other day uh on the pitch and he looked quite upset actually um because he obviously likes being your friend but he's been pretty critical of you as well when you people can have can have his own opinion but they don't really know what's going on for example inside the the the train ground and Carrington area or even my life they should listen not only one point of view they have to listen my point of view as well because it's easy to to criticize but if you don't know the old story it's it's it's easy you know but it's Pier as I say before it's it's part are they still friends of yours or do you have a line where they are not my friends they are colleagues we play together they they're not coming we not have a dinner together for example but but as I told you pierce before it's part of my journey they kill they keep criticizing me negativism every time so I follow I continue my my trip and uh I have to catch up the people who like me some of your ex- colleagues have been incredibly supportive Rio Ferdinand has always got your back Roy Keane always has your back whatever happens he's always supported you and has continued to do so does that mean a lot to you it means a lot because they I was in the dressing room with them they are part of my journey in football as well as I mentioned many times ring for me was my best capit ever Rio feran helped me a lot he was my neighbor I was his neighbor so very very good guys not just because they speak good about me but there they was there in the dressing room they are football players they know how players thinking and the behaves Etc and to listen Ace egg uh colleagues or teammates to criticize you and they only see one point of view do you feel a bit but do you feel a bit betrayed when they do that because you because you play together it's easy it's easy to criticize I don't know if you they have a job in television that they must criticize to a to be more famous I really don't understand but they use your name a bit to get attention I think they take advantage of that because they are not stupid and and I really understand and I have to carry on with my life with criticize criticize or or when the people speak good about you but it's hard when you see people who was in the dressing room with you criticize you in that way it must hurt it's not good yes I did but not Hur I I'm not going to be more slim I'm not going to sleep bad because of the criticize but it's not good to listen that disappointing a little bit yes disappointing do you have more pounds in the bank or more Instagram followers it's a good question probably similar I don't know probably similar uh I'm just trying to work out how Wayne Rooney could hate you even more and probably that's the answer well not only him imagine the rest of the rats they're going to criticize me too but it's good it's good to be still number one if you you see the make something that make me happy too if you see Forbes Magazine every year I'm in the top of the list so it's not by coincidence to but knowing you I don't it's not the money so much it's just you want to be at the top right I mean that's what I think what drives you someone said to me what drives Cristiano Ronaldo I don't think it's money I think it's being the best beating people it's a competitive streak the the records the adrenaline but Pierce let's let's let's be uh honest the last years the football change I see football now as a business to be honest sometimes Georgina have expression that I don't understand they treat you they treat you players like a piece of meat I say yes you say everything it's true when they want you when they they they they count with you they give you everything when they don't they try to to make a hard life to you I see football P the last years as a business I saw many many things that I'm disappointing the passion for the game still intact but in the same way I say I saw other things as well which is is surprised me but in the same way uh it's part of the business because if you see the world how it is in the moment it's it's all business everyone take itself everyone there are more individual well you become a commodity don't you where if you can sell record number of shows in 24 hours great right but if suddenly the team isn't performing well and they need someone to blame it looks to me like at Manchester United the default position is it's got to be Cristiano's fault exactly it's always always my fault the problem is always me I look like I'm the black ship which is is I don't like if you do it good or if you do bad they always going to find some some criticize even in the national team the last three months as I told you before the criticize was so bad I mean not only in football way but professional and family way as well which surprised me a lot look like I was a bad guy which is is not true people have to listen from my mouth the real the facts as well this is why I give this interview because I thought I I think it's the the right time to speak out of my my mind which is what they say the last four or five months is completely garbage I'm not going to say 100% but 99% is what garbage people say false things or light things which things have annoyed you the most family issues um I want to talk about one in particular on that which is when you were late back for the preseason training a lot of speculation because you'd said several weeks before that you wanted to play Champions League football and that you were maybe looking for another option because it didn't look like United would get to play champ let's make my points for example the preseason moment and after you mention new clubs or the interesting for example the preseason I had a very very bad witches I don't say nobody the people who surround me they so friends and even my my mom I had some problems in vacation that my young daughter they have a little problem they have bronet which is Sy bronchitis bronchitis yes yes your a little baby yes I was in myor in holidays and she stayed one week in hospital which is was you know you don't enjoy a lot and after what had happened so wor exactly and the people make make up histories that they say that I don't want to go travel P they people have to understand that I'm human being I'm always going to be in my side of my family I'm not negotiate nothing beyond that you understand and I even have the the lects of from the hospital the the feedback of the health of Bella which is I'm not sure nobody nobody asked me I have I keep for me people forget that I'm human human being that I passed through a difficult moments well you must have been worried sick I mean you I was very you lost your baby son and now your baby daughter's in hospital exactly and you must have been absolutely I spoke with directive of and the president of U Manchester United and then kind of that didn't believe believe that something going wrong which is is make me feel bad really yes I yes they didn't believe you they believe you but in the same way they are there I never P ever going to change uh the health of my family for the football never now or 10 years behind or forward and it's something that really hurt me because they doubt of my words that a struggle especially B and Gio we had one week in hospital because the B have a big problem and I didn't go to the preseason because of that because I didn't I didn't was allowed to left my family if something happened to do it the pre season because I think it wasn't not fair to left my family for a preseason this is why I didn't go I mean that would if my employer didn't believe a story like that that would I would be so angry because everyone I'm not mention only in that in that Manchester way but in the world especially in the football World they are very very very individual everyone everyone everyone own look for on themselves or themselves they don't care about your moments your struggle moments your issues family problems they want want you they want you doesn't matter your family problems I don't mean Manchester but in the general as I told you before the football goes so fast you have many competition many games PR season World Cup now listen we have last you have one game after three four days you have to be in a national team preparation for the World Cup it's hard sometimes you have to sell everything and you know be with your family take the best decisions and in this summer I didn't feel comfortable I feel uncomfortable the way they treat me especially the the Press they doubt about me the professional that I am it's impossible to be 21 in the top of the game if you're not professional they they they doubt about me which is make me feel very very very sad because in my life I'm always one of the best professional this is why I still play in the eye level you play in a preseason friendly and you leave the ground early with several other players and there's another huge fuss about this what was the truth about that had you got permission to go do you wish you hadn't left early now ten hog wasn't happy it was reported what's the truth um I I will be honest with you um it's something that I regret to left from the the stadium probably or maybe no I don't know it's difficult to to tell you 100% if I'm but let's say I regret but in the same way I felt provoked by the coach I I don't not allowed for me uh a coach to put me three minutes in a game Sorry I'm I'm not that kind of player I know what I can give to the teams you're talking about the Tottenham thing the Tottenham yeah I'm talking about in preseason it was a friendly where you left the ground with several other me and eight players right so but they mention only my name yeah which is his everyone do that I don't understand why they mention only about K Val kind of play game last year many players do it the same in that game eight players do it the same so but they only speak about the black Chip which is is me which is I completely understand okay it's done I apologize to the coach and for me the chapter was was closing it seemed to me that right from the start ten hog wanted to show you who the boss was he dropped you he benched you he mucked you around he talked about you in the Press were you getting that feeling I mean did you feel that the feeling he always mentioned to me that I didn't need the preseason so I should wait for my opportunity I really understand I should well okay and understand but I'm not going to give you points but you don't do it the same predent from to every players I'm not going to mention players but they don't do it the same way second I understand that coming a new job Manchester was so bad the last five years that he should make they should clean the house let's say in that way but the way they approach the way the Press make this so big it's because probably the the communication wasn't the best um but I I I really understand in the beginning because I didn't do the preseason I don't start to play but going more farther than that further than that other things happen that people they don't know and I'm not I'm not uh iding that the empathy with the coach is not good I'm I'm I'm honest have a good relationship with him I'm not mean good relationship the empathy is not not good let's say do you think he respects you I think he don't he don't respect the way I should deserve um but it is what it is this is why probably the the game against Tottenham I well I want to come to these two games so against Manchester City where United got destroyed he didn't bring you on he brought other Strikers but didn't bring you on and I felt insulted on your behalf I was like surely against Manchester City if you're losing this badly and you've got the greatest player of all time sitting there you at least give him some time don't you but he didn't and he said afterwards the reason was he had too much respect for you he wanted to respect you when you heard him say that what did you think excuses I see as excuses um I saw many things that um I don't want to I don't want to criticize him he can he can have different opinion than me that they choose the players that I think it's better for the team I respect that but the excus is all the time you know the excuses have short legs you canot excuses all the time which is things that don't make sense okay you don't put me against Manchester City because of respect of your career and you want to put me three minutes against Tottenham well that's the thing so then you then play Tottenham don't make sense and then he wants to bring you on with three minutes to go which is the complete opposite to what he said the situation was with City I think he did he did he did propose because for example in the national team the other clubs if the coach want to put me five minutes if someone injured or or if they really need me I will help but in that way I felt provoke not only because of that game but before some he was deliberately provoking it well everyone everyone know that everyone disrespecting you think exactly this is why I say I don't have respect for him because he don't show me respect for me this is why we we are we are in that situation I have to be I have to be honest that the things don't going well because of that because the empathy don't exist and he keep he keep say things for the Press but the Press say what they think it's it's it's good to protect probably him and Manchester United but as I know as I understand many things that he signed three years contract with Manchester United probably I'm not going to be too much longer in Manchester United apart when I'm finish my contract I really understand but I like guys that they don't like they speak honest they be frontal frontal and I'm not neg negotiate my morals my morals always will be intact and what what's going in my in my in my things the last two months was um not respect in many ways which is it I can regret for example against Tottenham to left the stadium before uh the Finish Well there's a video clip which appears to show ten hog telling you to get ready to come on and you gesticulate back to him I'm not going to do that and as a result you get suspended for the next couple of games and he goes public and says it's because you refused to come on and you did then issue a statement of some regret saying you know you're a professional and you never been suspended before I don't think in your entire career I mean when you look back at that I guess my question would be you've always been very acutely aware of Your Role Model status around the world do you wish with hindsight you hadn't done that and handled it a different way prob I regret to left the stadium yeah but I was as I told the pce before I didn't felt that he had respect for me to put me on three minutes after the issues that we had before um I was very very very very disappointing for the communicator of Manchester United to be honest I never had a problem with any club with any coach and they suspend me three days which is is I felt a lot and it was and and and level of sport clubs I felt a lot and it was a shame is it humiliating for you I think so yes I have to to say the truth what I felt I remember I arrive I I arve well I don't I don't want to say I don't want to say details what he pretend to do it but I'm not going to say that but I remember arriving home and Christian see me Daddy you not go to the game I said no because the club punish me with three days and he D like how how they gonna punish you if you are the best player in the world and uh you're not going to play say no I'm not going to play because I I'm not being I'm behave and you look at me like my daddy not be behaved but in one way I was good because I was like more relaxed but in the same way I feel very disappointed because okay I regret I apologize I'm not perfect I commit a mistake but to suspend me three games three days for that I think it's too much and then they make fire for the Press which is is really disappoint me and that seems to have been the pattern of the way tenh har has wanted to treat you since he became manager just constant attempts to disrespect you I guess many many points happen I think in some certain points I think was strategy from the club for me to react like that because they wanted you to leave probably yes they're trying to force you out yes not only the coach but the other two or three guys they around the club at the senior executive level yes that I felt betrayed and you think they're trying to get rid of you honestly I should don't say that I don't know but listen I I don't care I'm always people should listen the true yes I feel betrayed and I felt that some people that don't want me here not only this year but last year too they didn't want you to go there at all no really yes the owners of the club they listen they don't the glazes the glazes they don't they don't care about about the club I mean professional uh sport as you know this Manchester is a marketing Club they will get his money from from the marketing the sports it's they they don't really care in my opinion you ever talk to them the glazers never never never not since you've gone back no they give all the power to the president the sport directive a lot of Manchester United fans are very negative about the glazers they think they're taking all the money out and not spending enough on players on the infrastructure issues he talked about do you think the fans are right the fans are they're always right I think the fans should know the true should know that the players we want the best for the club I want the best of the club this is why are coming to Manchester United this is why I love this club but you have some things inside the club which is don't help to Manchester reach the top level as City Liverpool and even now Arsenal for example which is complicated it's difficult uh um it's hard in my opinion it will be hard for Manchester to be in the top of the game the next two three years ifaz if the glazes stays own it I'm not mean the the glazes but the structure the structure um as as Picasso say you have to destroy it to rebuild and if they can start from me I'm for me it's not a problem I'm all is going to say I love Manchester United I love the fans they're always on my side but if they want to do it different era different generation they have to change many many things when you walked away at Spurs and didn't go on Gary Neville said your behavior was unacceptable called for you to be punished he said he knows what he's doing he's experienced and players of that power have a real negative impact when they do it the influence they have on other players is really negative and it was after that that you gave them the old blank treatment uh which was very funny by the way um but for Neville to say that about you they can't they can't they they only they don't see the big picture why I react like that what's happened all the behind the scenes all the behind the scenes I was probably not provoke they will accept to play three minutes after the all situations that going through the last two months don't tell me that top players the guys want everything the key players will play three minutes come on this isn't acceptable after what they keep saying before that they respect me they do this they do that for me it wasn't not respect this is why I take this decision I regret I've I apologize to my teammates for the situation I did a post in Instagram I regret to left from the stadium uh I regret my teammates they know what I felt I said to them apologize but in the same way I'm not regret to take the decisions to don't coming on I'm I'm like that I will be always like that if you don't have respect for me I'm never going to have respect for you and the coach didn't have respect for me so this is why the relationship it's it's in that way and he keep saying in the press that he count with me like me blah blah blah blah blah blah but it's only for the Press really yes 100% so where are you now in your head with all this because the World Cup is about to start you're going to go there with Portugal and we'll talk about that in a moment uh with a very exciting team actually um but where are you with United they won't be playing again now until after Christmas that leaves a few days before the January transfer window do you think you'll still be a United player come January 1 it's difficult to tell her right now P because we my mood is right now to the World Cup it's probably my last World Cup of course my fifth World Cup I don't know what's going to happen um after the World Cup but as I told you before and I will say again the fans will be always in my heart and I hope they being in my side uh even if I back or if I'm not back or if I stay or whatever nobody's perfect episodes in the life we all have uh is part of the human beings he part of me to be a human being and father as well I always will commit a mistakes uh but I don't know it's hard to tell you right now what's going to happen in the World Cup because my focus is only for the World Cup for the Portugal national team if you had your time again knowing what was going to happen would you sign for Manchester United again as I told in the beginning I'm always took my decisions by I not emotional moments but maybe this this decision I took by emotional I'm not regret uh because I took with 100% conscience but it was more emotional than rational don't know if it's Mak sense uh but it was good it was good because I was happy when they left me be happy so I try to give my advises my experience uh to help Manchester United to be where they deserve to be um I don't pretend to be more smart than the other ones nobody is smarter than me but I'm not smarter than nobody when I arrive in Manchester United I always be available to help the team to do the good things to put in a right spots to compete with the best teams but it's hard when they they cut your legs and then they don't like you to shine and they don't listen to your advice is I think I I I have a word to advise to the club because the trophies that I won individual and Collective I think I can help a lot but when the infrastructure is not good what's amazing is you ended last season with hat tricks he scoring Hatt tricks for fun one against Tottenham you know you were playing great football but you were starting most games and now this season you barely started any game something happened you know I'd imagine you're a bit like a racehorse right if you don't start I did inde the preseason right right is the is the excuse right which is ridic the preseason so you think if you've been able to just do what you did last season you just carried on scoring for sure you think I I I this learn to score goals maybe I'm not motivated that I'm supposed to be probably as I told you before because I'm human being I feel the things I'm not perfect but my motivation is not the same that I was that I was a few months ago um I hope to change do you feel like you need a fresh challenge I'm not saying if it's fresh fresh challenge but let's see let's see I'm not I cannot answer right now because my focus is for the World Cup but I don't know maybe it's good for Manchester and better and probably it's good for me as well to have a new chapter probably but I don't know if if I will be back I will be the same Cristiano but I hope people being on my side and let me shine like I did all the clubs and all years what is the truth about other clubs making offers for you some people have said there were no offers a tool I happened to know that there was a gigantic one from Saudi Arabia I ex 350 million euros for two seasons is that true yes it's true that's a staggering sum of money yes which you turned out in that moment yes I mean that to me says you're not just about the money is what it's what I'm going to mention now it's they say many many garbage think that if you are agent what you going to do you go the clubs but George Mendes for example have more than 100 players and they go Chelsea they go Arsenal they always mention Cristiano Ronaldo they offer Cristiano B let's be honest who is the most expensive player salary player that Premier League have in history it's me even with 37 years old why they're going to even they even offer me to sporting or Napolis I will be honest with you you don't I didn't have many many clubs but I have many many offers of the other clubs right which is I did didn't change because I didn't plan to do it but I have but what the Press keeping say and the garbage PR say that nobody want me which is is completely wrong and um I was happy here to be honest I was motivated to do it a great season here but but they continue to repeat nobody want Cristiano how how they don't want to player who last year scored 32 goals with national team I mean that's the point I don't get because there are people out there and you see them you hear them and they say well he's not the player he used to be as if somehow at 37 you're going to be as good as you were at 21 anyway everyone Chang but you are the greatest 37 year old anyone's ever seen right and you're still extremely fit so it just seems to me nothing's changed from the player I saw banging in hatrick last season except you have a coach who doesn't want to start you a few months what they're going to change there nothing you feel like you can still be a top player but for me it's it's it's it's stupid question when the people say ah they are not the same nobody is the same day by day we're getting old everyone of us you understand it's normal you have to adapt and I think nobody in this game have this brain that adapt with his age I'm not I'm not going to be cocky to say that I'm the same that when I as 20 of course no but I'm adapt and I be smart to know my strength what I'm good to do and I'm still playing the high level and I score goals and I will continue to score goals if my mind is clear and happy and if the people surround me that help me to be successful player especially the coach the president directives but when you feel that the energy don't go surround you it's difficult you to be yourself which is happen this is what's happened with me but what they say the last three months is completely garbage and wrong they say that I offer me this and that and many presidents and directives speak about they reject from it's completely lie they lie because is is is not what's happened I had many clubs not many a few clubs that they want me to sign and I didn't go because I feel comfortable here this is the truth how easy is it to turn down 350 million pounds to kick a football for two years in Saudi Arabia it's hard it's hard it's hard but in the same way I I thought that I was very happy here that I still capable to score goals and make people out is it also that you want to keep playing at the highest level that you want to play Champions League Football you want to keep breaking records is it again it comes back to my gut feeling about you that if it was just about money you would be you'd be in Saudi Arabia right earning this king's Ransom but you that's not what motivates you you want to keep at the top exactly because I thought I I I still believe that I can score many many goals and helped the team because I I I still believe that I'm I'm still good and capable to help national team even Manchester United but if you don't feel surround you that the energies is then in your side it's difficult of course the criticizm going to exist all the time I 37 is still not the same but I want to see if some guy of my AGS maintain the level that I that I show I'm the fourth guy in EAS of football with more games no goalkeeper no goalkeeper which is I know how to be good how to be fit how to protect your body you're not going to teach me that nobody going to teach me that I know you as fit as you've ever been do you think yes yes in this moment I feel very very good I expect to have a few minutes more in my legs but I saw yesterday I have 1,000 minutes plus uh 118 from the national team I still good I'm still feeling good fresh I believe that I'm going to do amazing world cup I'm prepared physically mentally but peer is it it is what it is uh life is good I'm good my mental is good I'm happy to do this interview with you I know they're going to generate many pmic of course but Christian they would anyway right I mean they've all had their say and now you're entitled to have your say and you know better than anybody because you are Christian now they criticize me when I don't speak of course when I'm going to speak they criticize me even more but it's something that I can I can deal with that uh I know I'm going to disappointing a few people maybe I'm going to make Happ a few people but it is what it is the life is it's completely difficult we have obstacles in our lives and um I will keep running to fight against the people who don't believe me and the life is a challenge and I want to people the people that they are wrong when they say that if you do leave United and I accept that this is not a done decision either way but if you do and it seems to me like it's more likely than not as we sit here what would your message be to Manchester United fans you've had to read all this stuff all year and probably have a very mixed idea about where the truth lies what would you say to them if you do end up leaving it's hard it's hard for me to say that I will not be back to Manchester United but regardless as you say it's it's let's see what's going to happen but as I told you before the fense for me always will be in my side will be always in my heart I see during the days when I go to the streets the love the passion the people have for me um the respect I hope that they never forget the things that I will continue to do it not only in the past but in the present too Manchester will be always in my side defense will be always in my side doesn't matter what's going to happen and I appreciate the love that they send for me all the time even when I'm done play H we even when they when they criticize me they always will be in my heart so thank you to all supports I hope to see you soon and uh they always will be in my heart and what about srax the man who persuaded you to come back again really like a father figure to you really in many ways like another another father to you what's his take on everything that's been happening what's his opinion of all this I don't speak with him like one month ago but it's always on my side he always understand me he knows that he knows better than nobody that the club is not on the path that deserve to be he knows everyone knows the people who don't see that is because they don't want to see they are blame the fans um they are always the answer and the passion for the game Manchester belong to the fans but they should know the TRU the infrastructure they are not good they should change if not Manchester not going to be where they used to be with when Sir Alex Ferguson David Gil was and um I hope to be part if they count with me to help the club to be successful if not the life will continue I will continue to my journey I will continue to make fans happy uh and score goals and do it uh tricks and everything and um it's good it's part of my journey I want to just talk to you briefly about the World Cup um your fifth World Cup you say it's your last but I mean you'd only be 41 at the next one could we have a sixth World Cup potentially we be tough will be tough so this may be the last one probably yes you've got an exciting team full of experience and young players Portugal are you optimistic about your I'm very optimistic we have a fantastic coach we have a good generation of football players I'm looking forward that we're going to do it amazing world cup I hope the Portuguese belong in our side we need them we need them the fans the fans we have a little bit thebat in Portugal from some issues that they should pick more other players that it's normal a little bit negativism to be honest from the Press from some people maybe X players as well but I believe that we're going to do it to World a good World Cup would that be for you the the Pinnacle of your career to win a world cup with Portugal please I don't I don't I never well I dreamed one time about that uh holding the World Cup yes going to be tough extremely difficult but everything is possible but of course we're going to compete it's hard to beat who are the who are the biggest Rivals do you think we are not the favorites never we are never favorites no of course but who do you were the favorites when you won the exactly exactly who do you think are the ones to really watch who are the best squads out there probably France France um I will put Spain Argentina Germany Brazil Brazil of course they look good to me they look good but after coming the Portugal so everything it's possible what about you haven't mentioned them ah England as well yeah yeah yeah of course England you think England have a have a chance have a chance beside Portugal in my opinion uh but let's see we'll be different will'll be in a winter is it weird play it winter do you care do you care I don't really care to be honest a part of the issues that the country wherever they tried to to they Tred to speak now that it wasn't not good option to do it there but they should do that before we we should focus only in football the competition to people to enjoy do you think all the politics and the mor morality debates and stuff should that all be left aside now 100% focus on the on the game I feel that of course they should they should do that that debate should be had before you award exactly exactly they should concentrate it in in all competition all the national teams the people to be welcome in a in uh in Qatar and I I see I see a good tournament to be honest I think Qatar they are prepared they are prepared for that and will be we to play in the beginning of the Season yes but in the same way a challenge I think it's to be honest is good I feel good I feel with good energy so what about this idea you get to the final Portugal the Argentina you score two Messi scores two the last minute 94th minute you score a third for your hattick and you win the World Cup is that be honest too good come on is that the dream it's too good I didn't expect that too good dream but if it happened a come on it's that's the dream he can scare he can or another player I don't care I don't care if the Portugal be in the final and score even the goalkeeper I will be the most happy man in the world but if if this happen come on I will say I will finish football if this happen that's it you retire right yeah I retired 100% 100% I mean it may well be Messi's last World Cup he's never won it either I mean you are you know you're linked forever the pair of you to me the greatest has ever been you're number one for me uh thank you he's number two you're number one to you he's number two um but it's an amazing relationship you have even though you're not I know great friends or anything but you're always respectful when you see each other what do you think of him Messi now as you both head to maybe your last World Cup as a football player yeah and as a as a person amazing player is Magic top as a person we Shar stayed 16 years imagine 16 years we at the highest we share so I have great relationship with him I'm not friend of him in terms of when I mean friend is the guy who who is with you in your house who speaking the phone no but he like a teammate he's a guy that I really respect the way he always speak about me even his wife for my wife my girlfriend they always respect they are from Argentina my and is's from Argentina so good what I'm going to say about Messi great things he's a good guy he's you do everything for football the best player you've ever seen excluding yourself probably yes him zidan probably uh yes that I play fight with him yes have you ever had dinner together never would you like to why not one day to sit down and yes I'm listen I I love can I can I come I love of course I love to meet people I love people you know I live I love to share things ideas learn things ideas new histories New Brains why not I will do it for sure I will do it that would be in a few years at the bat as Maradona and Pelle did yes no problem come on I'm I'm a good person I know I have I have a good heart and you know I'm I don't like I don't like to you know to criticize people it's not the way I I took my life everything is positive and if there's like a weird sequence of events and mbappe goes to Real Madrid and PSG ring you up and go we've had a great idea we want to put Messi and Ronaldo everything it's everything it's possible in in in football so and that would be incredible why not I don't know I don't know as I told you before they'd sell some shirts for sure for sure for sure they will sell a lot of shirts but as a so the pce before um the life the life is good and my focus right now it's to do it amazing world cup are also going to win the Premier League I hope so you Manchester first if not if not Arsenal it's some team that I like to see to play did you rate the team at the moment yes I do I like the team I like the coach I think they they do it a good team and uh if Manchester United don't win the Premier League I will be happy if Arsenal do what would you like your legacy to be Christian I mean well let me ask you first do you have any plans to retire I mean how long do you think you can keep playing football I want to play two years more three years more two three years more maximum I want to play with want to finish with 40 I think will be a 40 40 a good age but I don't know I don't know the future sometimes you plan you plan one thing for your life and as I told many times the life is the night Dynamic and you never know what's going to happen Tom Brady in America the great NFL quarterback retired then he has a conversation with you on the Old Trafford pitch and whatever you said to him I'm psychologue so the next day he comes out of retirement psych you see I'm good psychologue what did you say I thought I thought he he he he took the decision a few weeks before uh but it was good what did you talk about you two go you speak about in a general he's very very smart guy uh in knows a lot about football we have a nice conversation and uh you scor a hatrick that day yes I did he gave me good energy when I have good good energy when you have another goat in the stadium does that fire you up exactly when you have another it's a goat thing right yes yes yes energies it's all about energy when you are when you have good energy around you I can be interesting things what about Jordan Peterson who I know came to see you amazing man yeah CU I've interviewed him a few times and he was was fascinated to meet you and to talk to you both about private things about what had happened to your family this year but also about professionally you and your situation I'm I'm a huge fan of him I I read his book 12 rules uh and I felt that is really really interesting guy and I love to meet smart people when I

good person intelligent person and uh was fantastic and I we keep in touch I speak with him it's good you're going to do Cristiano Ronaldo's 12 rules to life why not for the future you morals exactly for the future probably I want to I want to educate it I want to educate not only my family but my fans as you know I have a lot millions of fans yeah probably for the future I want to do some book but not the type of book as I've I've got a good idea for you on that I told you it's a good one but to help people how to be how to maintain longevity and also I think in your case how does survive life right there's a lot of people out there who are struggling to just deal with life and the one thing you do better than anybody I've seen in sport is resilience mental strength right that's what it's really about I think it's the most important thing and I I can see me in the future of course I'm I want to improve my English it's very good it's much better even the last time I interviewed yeah but I I have to improve I have to do more interviews I have to improve I know and I'm I'm I'm I I I want to improve and I see myself to do it when I'm retired to speak from millions of people advices yeah how to be a professional player how to maintain your longevity how I'm not psychologue but I pass through many many things and I can you know above all how to win how to win which is the most important I think that's what it's all about I have experience to to expire people for that I think I'm I'm a role model and I I can help many many people in that way if they want my help I they want to listen to it right for sure especially the young people I want to be with the young people to speak with them not only for them but for the Fathers as well to put him in a in a right spot
